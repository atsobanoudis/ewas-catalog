# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity (Academic & Clean)
- **Palette:** Prioritize color-blind friendly palettes (e.g., Viridis, Magma) and high-contrast black-and-white for print. 
- **Typography:** Use standard academic sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Roboto) for clarity in figures and reports.
- **Layout:** Minimalist and organized. Figures should have clear labels, high-resolution (300+ DPI), and follow standard journal sizing conventions.
- **Customizability:** Aesthetics (colors, font sizes, line weights) should be easily configurable via a central style configuration file or class to allow for quick "tweaks" before submission.

## Voice and Tone
- **Interpretive yet Cautious:** Provide analytical summaries that synthesize complex findings (e.g., identifying gene clusters), but always frame them within the context of the data evidence.
- **Methodological Transparency:** Clearly document data provenance, versioning, and the specific algorithms used for evidence scoring or association ranking.
- **Limitation-Aware:** Every report or significant visualization must acknowledge data gaps, potential biases in source databases, and the distinction between correlation and causation.
- **Professionalism:** Language should be formal and ready for direct inclusion in a manuscript or grant application.

## Principles
- **Clarity Over Complexity:** Visualizations should be "self-explanatory" to a PI, requiring minimal effort to grasp the "wow-factor" insight.
- **Reproducibility:** Every output should be traceable back to the raw input files and the specific code version that generated it.
- **Integrity:** Never over-state an association; rely on composite scores and citation counts to anchor claims in established research.
